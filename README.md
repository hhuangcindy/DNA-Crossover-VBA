## Project Title:
DNA Crossover Generator
##Software Used
Excel Visual Basic
##Summary
A crossover on a chromosome is where the chromosome is cut and the DNA from two different 
ancestors is spliced together during meiosis as the DNA of the offspring is created when half of the DNA 
of the two parents combines. Identifying crossover locations, and who the DNA that we received came 
from is the first step in identifying the ancestor further back in our tree that contributed that segment of 
DNA to us.
